### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting Issues  
- Since this is a **beta version**, **lags**, **bugs**, and **crashes** are expected.  
- If you experience errors, provide a **screenshot of the console logs** and **describe what happened before the specified issue occurred**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Guide  
1. Download the `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` files.
