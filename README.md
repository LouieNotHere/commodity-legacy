# Commodity (Legacy)
Commodity is a simple plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) made for financial purposes.

Ever wanted to know how worth your Vault can be? This plugin can calculate how worth it can be!

This plugin simulates the estimated cost of your Vault in just a matter of seconds! Please note that the value may vary depending on how many files your vault contains.

# Why Legacy?
This is not only for minor updates, but add some minor features and preserve the old functionality of this plugin. I wanted to make this respond way simpler and faster.

# Features
- The **Active Note Value** feature, which redirects you to the right sidebar when clicked from the list of ribbons.
